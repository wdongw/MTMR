- This is a fork from MTMR: https://github.com/Toxblh/MTMR
- The new generation MBP from apple will not have touchbar. This is just for self usage. 
- This fork is to let the battery icon show a plug icon when 100% charge level and AC plugged. 
- This fork fixed the cpu object missing on the official newest release. 

I pretty like the touchbar.
